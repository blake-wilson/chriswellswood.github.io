Bits and pieces that I've written.

### TO DO

1. Make template for header/footer/nav
2. Insert content into page
    1. Make post as elm file
    2. Make it app load articles
3. Remove old markdown pages
4. Beautify
5. Mobile?
6. Embed analytics
7. Change date to date types
8. Home will be a more complex elm app to manage searching and sorting etc
9. Make a crawler in python to automatically find posts
    1. Have it fix the titles too
10. 505 page
11. Add post header, with banner etc.
12. Bring back the content manager?
    * It will allow the header and posts to reference other articles easily i.e. next or previous

### Notes

* `git subtree push --prefix site origin master`

### Post Ideas

1. Sauntering vaguely downwards - Starting to program late
1. GitHub pages with `index.html` in another directory.
