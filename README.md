Bits and pieces that I've written.

### TO DO

1. Port for `highlight.js`
1. Beautify
1. Mobile?
1. Embed analytics
1. Change date to date types
1. Home will be a more complex elm app to manage searching and sorting etc
1. 505 page
1. Bring back the content manager?
    * It will allow the header and posts to reference other articles easily i.e. next or previous
1. Move page views to modules
1. Quote formatting

### Notes

* `git subtree push --prefix site origin master`

### Post Ideas

1. Sauntering vaguely downwards - Starting to program late
